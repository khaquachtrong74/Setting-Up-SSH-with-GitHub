            <h1>How to set a strong mind?</h1>
            <p>Actually I don't know correctly how to build a strong mind. It clearly depends on us
                , Inside each of us is a 'demon' that can lead us astray.
            </p>
            <p>
                To combat this, start by creating a clear purpose—a reason to stay on the right path throughout your
                journey.

            <h1>Build Your Own System</h1>
            <p>
                In the book <em>Atomic Habits</em>, the author explains that achieving success isn’t just about setting
                goals—it's about building a system that supports consistent progress.

                        <strong>
                            Goals set the direction, but systems drive progress.
                        </strong>

                </u>
            </p>
            <p>
                Focus on creating a system of habits and routines that align with your long-term vision. It’s not the
                result that matters most; it’s the process that leads to it.

            <h1>The way keep move forward?</h1>
            <!-- <p>
                In my own way, I start with small habit like doing excersice every afternoon, cooking to learn about
                nutrients, start read book and clean mind set, clean my room every day. It is like when you can keep
                your good habits everyday, you can closer to your goals everytimes. My advice is keep your mind clean
                everytime then keep you avoid bad habits because when you doing a good things for you, your energy is
                plus 0.0000001%, but if you do a bad things then your process is reset 0% immediately. During your
                strategy being better everyday, you will get tired, depression, boring, bla bla bla... It is OK because
                that is the reason we have define "dopamin" this thing can help your mood rise up, but can bring your
                mood down to underground. We can get "dopamin" in everything we do in normal day, you can get it when
                play video game, doing your habits, read manga/comic, learn a new things ... but it just temporarily,
                after your high mood your body system will push you into underground because you will pay your good
                energy. So there is have another way to keep our mood high? yes it is.
                Clean your mind everytime you feel tired can reset your mood without
                <strike>dopamin</strike>. Furthermore, doing excersice everyday will keep your health in high condition,
                push your energy to your brain and help you easily to get well sleep.
            
            </p> -->
            <div class="box scroll-bar">
                <p>
                    It is a process of improve myself. It really really easy to make you go to wrong road.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’ve developed small habits to improve myself, like exercising every afternoon, cooking to learn
                    about
                    nutrition, reading books to clear my mindset, and cleaning my room daily. Maintaining good habits
                    every
                    day brings you closer to your goals. My advice is to keep your mind clear—it helps you avoid bad
                    habits.
                    When you make positive choices, your energy grows incrementally, but a single bad decision can reset
                    your progress to zero.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Improvement isn’t easy. You’ll feel tired, bored, or even depressed at times. That’s normal—it’s
                    part of
                    the process. Dopamine plays a significant role in this journey, as it can lift your mood temporarily
                    but
                    also drag you down afterward. We get dopamine from many activities: playing games, pursuing hobbies,
                    reading, or learning new skills. However, these highs are fleeting, and your energy eventually
                    depletes,
                    leaving you drained.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, how can we sustain a positive mood? The answer lies in consistently resetting your mind.
                    Whenever
                    you feel overwhelmed, take time to clear your thoughts—it works better than relying on dopamine.
                    Additionally, regular exercise not only improves your physical health but also boosts your energy
                    levels, sharpens your focus, and helps you sleep better.
